Parameter Space for ODEs
---

I have below the parameter space for the damped oscillator differential equation

![Parameter Space](/images/chaos_gallery_1/parameter_space.jpeg)

I wrote a jupter notebook where I calculate the parameter space for a couple of ODEs with solutions. I also calculated the numerical solutions of the ODEs for comparison. 
If you are interested I have a pdf of jupyter notebook below, along with a link to download the jupyter notebook. Please enjoy!
