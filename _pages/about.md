My name is Logan Knudsen and I am a mathematical physicist and physical oceanographer from Texas. I earned my B.S. in Mathematics with minors in Meteorology and Oceanography in 2023, and my M.S. in Atmospheric and Oceanic Science in 2025. I have research experience working with geophysical fluid dynamics and data assimilation, with projects including a study in parametric subharmonic instability in the oceanic bottom boundary layer, upwelling due to the bottom Ekman layer near the equator, and data assimilation for toy glacier models. My main research interests include:

- Geophysical Fluid Dynamics
- Applied Mathematics
- Fluid Mechanics
- Physical Oceanography
- Meteorology
- Climate Science

If you wish to contact me, my email is knudsen@umd.edu

Outside of academics and research, I have a deep passion for music, enjoy reading and am a longtime runner. I also enjoy dancing Lindy Hop on occasion.
